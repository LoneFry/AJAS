Created on  : 2005
               Began collecting JavaScript wheels into a central library
               Added various functions from 2005-2008
               Discovered jQuery in 2008, development ceased
               Picked up, dusted off, pushed into GitHub 2011-6-1

Many of these scripts are still useful, and still used, so I decided to share

Most of these scripts worked before I rearranged the code for publishing
I'll re-verify them as I re-use them, each function or file having notation

Contributions welcome
